# regression-analysis
Multiple linear regression is used to explore the relationship between one response variable and (one or more than one)predictor variables. In this case we gonna look at multiple linear regression and consider Y: response variable    X1,X2.....:predictor variables
#This data set is taken from an GPA study that measured 6 variablesï¼ˆcolumns2 to column7):
#column2 - students' GPA
#column3 - students' english scores
column4 - students' math scores
column5 - students' science scores
column6 - students' SAT math scores
column7 - students' SAT literature scores
And we need to analysis the relationship between GPA and english, science, math scores. 
To study the variation of GPA(Y), we fit an MLR model to the data using 3 explanatory variables: english scores(x1), math scores(x2), and science scores(x3)
The scatter plot matrix for the datais shown as below
